# Classifying-customers
(Python: sklearn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib) Use logistic regression to classify an e-commerce website's users on their purchasing likelihood based on their clickstream data. Check the data's integrity, account for imbalanced classification, create preliminary scatter plots with correlation figures, and train and fit a logistic regression model with regularization.
